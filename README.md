# Grapher2D
A 2d graphing calculator.

##Features
1. Graphs functions using opengl.
2. Has a 't' variable that mesures the amount of seconds since the function was submited to the grapher and a 'at' variable that mesures the amount of seconds since launch. They can be used to create moving functions.
3. Very very fast since it uses the GPU to do all the calculations

##Usage
Enter the equations into the textboxes and press the enter key to graph them. You can add and take away equation slots using the add graph and "X" buttons.

##Disclaimer
Must have an OpenGL 3.3+ capable graphics card and drivers

##Compiling
If you dont want to use the prebuilt binaries from the [project website](http://sharhar.github.io/projects.html), then you can build the project yourself. To build the project use cmake to generate the respective build files for your OS (internet connection required to download all the dependecies). Then build. It will build all the dependencies and link them automatically. The Executable will be in the bin folder in the cmake build directory.

##Dependencies
All dependencies are downloaded by Cmake when build files are generated.<br>
This project uses a library that I made called GLUI for window management and UI rendering. <br>
The dependecies of this library are:
* [GLFW] (http://www.glfw.org/) 3.2
* [FreeType] (https://www.freetype.org/) 2.6
* [glcorearb.h] (https://www.opengl.org/registry/api/GL/glcorearb.h)
